# Speed-detector

## Description
The system is an easy to use command-based system which takes the input of the speed of a car in km/h and compares it against a speed limit of 70 km/h. For every 5km/h above the speed limit(70km/h), the system automatically updates demerit points for the car .
To improve road cautiousness on the roads, the system helps traffic police and organistaions to keep track of demerit points of road users. If the speed of a vehicle exceeds the speed limit recklessly and accumulates more than 11 demerit points, then their license is stripped off them, and that is exactly what this system does.

## Installation

 For example, if the speed is 80, the programme prints: “Points: 2”.
